# Custom Checkout
Simplified order design.

## Description
A simple solution for real simplification of the ordering, with the setting of which any kettle will figure out. The module is divided into blocks, the content (fields, methods) of which can be configured individually (for example, for each delivery group, specify your fields, and for self-level and completely disable them).

When developing the module, experience and requirements for placing an ordering of online stores with high sales conversion was used.

## Installation
* Install the module through the standard installer
* Navigate to the settings of the Custom Order Module
* Perform the primary setting of the module
* Update the modifier cache (the built-in modifier is redirected from the standard pages of the basket and ordering the order to customizable.)

## What is inside
* The module has 8 basic blocks on one page
* Proceed as - (with registration, without registration and authorization)
* Basket (with a set of speakers required to display on the page)
* Personal data (setting up the fields for each group of users)
* Delivery (fields, with a mark for which methods to make a display)
* Payment (methods and user groups for display)
* Comment field
* Modules (such as gift certificates, coupons)
* Final table
